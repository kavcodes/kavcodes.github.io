One day, her window remained empty, and Daniel felt an inexplicable sadness wash over him. A week later, a letter appeared on his doorstep, thanking him for being the only light in her final days. The smile stayed with him forever.", upvotes: 0 },

His dog sat by the stove, staring in what Jake could only interpret as judgment. When he finally took a bite, he muttered, 'Well, at least itâ€™s edible'. His dog just sighed and walked away, clearly not impressed.", upvotes: 0 },

There were creatures in the bedroom, stalking around, checking in the cupboard, making low growls and high screeches and gutteral noises. As the feet approached the bed and one of the creatures climbed onto it, the pounding of my heart and the rumbling of my stomach seemed so loud that I feared they might give me away. Finally, after an agonisingly long time, I heard steps leaving the room, the lights being switched off, the door closing, and silence... I emerged from beneath the bed, hungry for my meal laying upon it.", upvotes: 0 },
